# Calculator Project
Your project is to create a **Command Line Calculator**

## Requirements
* You **must** show me a plan before you get started!
* Your program should present a list of calculations that your program can do
* You need at least five operations
    * Such as: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication
        * *You must use functions for each of these operations!*
* Each operation should take the appropriate amount of inputs
    * For example: division should take exactly two numbers
    * For extra credit you can take as many inputs as the user would like for operations like addition and multiplication 
* To begin with, the program should run exactly one time (i.e. one operation)
    * *Time permitting* the user should be able to do as many operations as they would like until they choose to exit the program 
* You may create alternative operations — feel free to get creative 
    * e.g. pizza calculator that takes in number of people and hunger level

## Groups:
* Briana + Natalie
* Gaby, Cami, Megan 

## A few reminders:
* Keep in mind the MVP (minimum viable product) 
    * At every stage of your program, I expect it to be able to function
    * Do NOT divide up all of the work and just expect it to all work at the end
* Come up with a clear plan in advance so that you know what you are trying to create 
* This project is meant to test your understanding of variables, user input, conditional logic, loops and functions 
    * Arrays and hashes might come in handy for the extra credit portions, but will not be particularly useful for the rest of the project
    
## Things to think about:

+ Do you want your user to enter a math problem like you would write it on paper (`1 + 1`) or do you want to take in each piece of data individually?

+ Do you want your user to enter a `+` or `add` or `addition` or all three?

+ What math problems do you want to solve? Just the basics? What about square roots?

+ Do you want a basic calculator or do you want it themed? (Students in the past have done a tip calculator to make eating out easier, or a average income generator, feel free to get creative!)
